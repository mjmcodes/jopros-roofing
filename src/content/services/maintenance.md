The best method of extending the life of your roof is to maintain it. At Jopros Roofing LLC, we understand that proper repairs and maintenance can save money in the long run. That’s why we offer comprehensive maintenance roof plans to fit your needs and budget.

We recommend a roof inspection to all of our industrial, commercial, and institutional clients to survey the state of their roofs. Following a detailed written report with photos of areas that need to be addressed, we can set up annual or semi-annual agreements, or per project contracts to ensure your roof’s longevity is maintained. We also provide emergency repair services and 24-hour responses. Whether you have a leak, open joints, tears, splits, or punctures that need repair, sheet metal flashing in need of replacement, clogged drains and gutters, or debris in need of removal, we send our certified staff to complete the service to your satisfaction.
