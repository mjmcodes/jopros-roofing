The most essential thing in life is to have a roof over our heads. A home is a secured place only if it has a solid roof upon it. Residential roof needs quality roofing shingles, underlaymentâ€™s, hip and ridge, starter shingles, etc. to keep the roof in good condition. However, over the years, the external forces like strong winds, heavy rain, falling debris and pests have the potential to damage the roof of your house. In some cases, leaking roof could be a result of sub-standard products used for roofing needs or improper installation of these products on your roof. Even the tiniest hole in your roof can lead to damaged ceiling, paint erosion, spoiled carpets and your much adored sofa set, but most of all it can snatch away your peace of mind.
